	abstract = {The past 5 years have witnessed a flurry of RCT evaluations that shed new light on the impact and cost effectiveness of Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs) aiming to improve workers´ access to new jobs and better wages. We report the first systematic review of 102 RCT interventions comprising a total of 652 estimated impacts. We find that (i) a third of these estimates are positive and statistically significant (PPS) at conventional levels; (ii) programs are more likely to yield positive results when GDP growth is higher and unemployment lower; (iii) programs aimed at building human capital, such as vocational training, independent worker assistance and wage subsidies, show significant positive impact, and (iv) program length, monetary incentives, individualized follow up and activity targeting are all key features in determining the effectiveness of the interventions.},

	abstract = {Online professional networking platforms are widely used and offer the prospect of alleviating labor market frictions. We run the ﬁrst randomized evaluation of training workseekers to join one of these platforms. Training increases employment at the end of the program from 70 to 77\% and this effect persists for at least twelve months. Treatment effects on platform use explain most of the treatment effect on employment. Administrative data suggest that platform use increases employment by providing information to prospective employers and to workseekers. It may also facilitate referrals but does not reduce job search costs or change self-beliefs.},

We conduct a field experiment that generates exogenous variation in the assignment to different policy regimes to caseworkers. The experiment allows us to provide evidence on the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programs and to study how caseworkers exploit their discretion in assigning these programs to welfare recipients. We find substantial heterogeneity in how caseworkers assign welfare-to-work programs. Participation in the experiment and learning about the effectiveness of the different programs does not induce caseworkers to focus more on the effective programs. This implies that obtaining knowledge about welfare-to-work programs is not enough to improve policy, also effort on implementation is required.},

The intervention increased job-finding rates, particularly among job seekers aged 35-50 (up to 8 percentage points), with larger effects for women within this age group (up to 10 percentage points). The quality of job matches improved too.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a large-scale two-level randomized experiment to study direct and displacement eﬀects of job search assistance. Our ﬁndings show that the assistance reduces unemployment among the treated, but also creates substantial displacement leading to higher unemployment for the non-treated. By using detailed information on caseworker and job seeker behavior we show that vacancy referrals passed on from caseworkers to job seekers is the driving mechanism behind the positive direct eﬀect. We also examine explanations for the displacement eﬀect and show that displacement is not due to constrained resources, but arises in the labor market. A comparison between diﬀerent meeting formats suggests that face-to-face meetings and distance meetings are more eﬀective than group meetings. Despite the existence of displacement eﬀects, when we incorporate our results into an equilibrium search model we ﬁnd that a complete roll-out of the program would lead to lower unemployment and reduced government spending.},
