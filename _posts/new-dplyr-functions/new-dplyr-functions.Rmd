```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I probably use `dplyr` everyday, so I was excited to read the news about two new functions, `if_any` and `if_all`.  This is in addition to `across` which I've [written about before](https://robcoleman.ca/posts/dplyr-tricks/) and is also great.  Let's take a quick look at the shiny new helpers.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

penguins %>% 
  glimpse() 

penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

Let's try only tubby penguins with body mass > 4500

```{r}

```
