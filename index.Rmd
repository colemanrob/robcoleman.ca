## `r emo::ji("wave")`  Hi, I'm Rob!

I think and write most often about how to solve problems using [r, the programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) for data science. At work I think about [active labour market policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_labour_market_policies), and lead analytics for [ONTatwork](https://twitter.com/ONTatwork).
