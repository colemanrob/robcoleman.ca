	abstract = {Using Work Training in Norway as a case, this article provides insight into motivation and structural factors that impact employer engagement with active labour market policies (ALMP) targeting young people. Drawing on mixed-methods data, we ﬁnd a substantial proportion of Norwegian employers engage in Work Training. Both social responsibility and the economic interests of the company inﬂuence employers’ motivation for committing to Work Training. The ﬁndings reveal that the structural factors of business size and sector are crucial determinants of employer behaviour when it comes to hiring Work Training candidates. Although improved outreach activities by local job centres may be important, the article argues that efforts towards opening up sectors closed by sectorspeciﬁc regulations on hiring, and increased awareness of structural constraints, are similarly important.},

	title = {The {Growing} {Importance} of {Decision}-{Making} on the {Job}},
	url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w28733.pdf},
	abstract = {Machines increasingly replace people in routine job tasks. The remaining tasks require workers to make open-ended decisions and to have “soft” skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking and adaptability. This paper documents growing demand for decision-making and explores the consequences for life-cycle earnings. Career earnings growth in the U.S. more than doubled between 1960 and 2017, and the age of peak earnings increased from the late 30s to the mid-50s. I show that a substantial share of this shift is explained by increased employment in decisionintensive occupations, which have longer and more gradual periods of earnings growth. To understand these patterns, I develop a model that nests decision-making in a standard human capital framework. Workers predict the output of uncertain, context-dependent actions. Experience reduces prediction error, improving a worker’s ability to adapt using data from similar decisions they have made in the past. Experience takes longer to accumulate in high variance, non-routine jobs. I test the predictions of the model using data from the three waves of the NLS. Life-cycle wage growth in decision-intensive occupations has increased over time, and it has increased relatively more for highly-skilled workers.},

	abstract = {Case managers provide individual and comprehensive support to employees who have become incapable of work‑ing. Using data from a large insurance company we find that overall, 43.9\% of the people in our sample could be reintegrated. Controlling for personal characteristics, we analyze the effectiveness of case management by modelling the probability of reintegrating people being incapable of working into the labor market. Using parametric and sem‑iparametric decomposition methods, we control for observational differences. We analyze how much of the differ‑ence in the reintegration rate between people who participate in case management and those who do not, is due to differences in characteristics and how much is due to case management itself. We find that the estimated probability of reintegration is 18.9\% higher if people participate in case management. Moreover, our results show that no more than 15\% are due to differences in characteristics and at least 85\% can be attributed to case management itself.},

	abstract = {Workers who experience involuntary job loss suffer from deep and persistent negative consequences. In this paper, we first summarise the evidence on the effects of involuntary job loss on displaced workers’ wellbeing. We conclude that displacement harms workers’ mental health and economic security in the short term and negatively affects their earnings and mortality risk in the long term. We then extrapolate the estimates of Hyslop and Townsend (2017) to estimate the economy-wide net-present value of wages lost as a result of displacement by the workers displaced in New Zealand in a representative year. Our estimates suggest that this value is likely between \$3.3 billion (in a year of economic upswing) and \$15.4 billion (in a year of very severe economic downswing). Finally, we survey the policy options available for dealing with involuntary displacement. We conclude that unemployment insurance or unemployment benefits can effectively mitigate the immediate negative effects of displacement and have only small downsides. By contrast, training and job placement programs are typically ineffective, but in some circumstances might have high potential upside.},

	abstract = {The canonical supply–demand model of the wage returns to skill has been extremely inﬂuential; however, it has faced several important challenges. Several studies show that the standard approach sometimes produces theoretically wrong-signed elasticities of substitution, yields counterintuitive paths for skill-biased technical change (SBTC), and does not account for the observed deviations in college premia for younger vs. older workers. This paper shows that these failings can be explained by mis-measurement of relative skill prices and supplies (based on standard demographic composition-adjustments) and by inadequate ad hoc functional form assumptions about the path for SBTC.},

I find that job search intensity is counter-cyclical, adding to the mixed results of prior studies that mainly rely on data from the US. This finding is robust to using different measures of search intensity and business cycle indicators. The counter-cyclical pattern seems to be driven by changes in the composition of searchers.},
